Also, Interpreter provide to run the part of code instead of running it all. Therefore, it will be much helpful to learn and to experiment any part developer wants."

    "Python 3 is new version of Python 2 after deugging. Python 3 came with a new syntax intended to prevent the repetitive code which does the same task in different ways. So, Python 3 has readable and easily understandable syntax than python 2. Also, it was improved the performace of runtime. The print fuction was also added in Python 3. For ineger division, Python 3 always return the float value while Python 2 returned the integer value. Python 3 is not backwardly compatible with Python 2. Fortunately, it is easy to port Python 2 to Python 3. "
